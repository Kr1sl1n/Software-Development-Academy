1. Create a Rectangle class that will implement the Shape interface,
implement a method that calculates the field and perimeter.
The class should contain private fields int "sideA" and "sideB".
Add a two-parameter Rectangle counter (sideA, sideB)

2. Create a Circle class that will implement the Shape interface,
then implement the method that calculates the field (Hint: use Math.PI) and the perimeter.
The class should contain one private field "radius".
Add single-parameter constructor Circle (radius)

3. Create a Square class that will inherit from the Rectangle class.
Add a single-parameter Square (side) constructor,
which will be called by a two-parameter constructor (super) Rectangle class.

//    REMEMBER!!!
//    Write unit tests in test package. You can copy existing test class and make it similar.
